<h1>Julia Muench</h1>
<p>
    Since 2022 I am a PhD student at the University of Liverpool under the supervision of Daniel Meyer. My main interests are complex 
    dynamics, especially Thurston theory, quasi-regular and quasi-conformal mappings and Sullivan's dictionary. 
</p>
<p>
    I did my Bachelor's and Master's degree at the University of Bern.

    I have tought an interactive class about 4-dimensional regular convex polytopes aimed at high-school students with a focus
