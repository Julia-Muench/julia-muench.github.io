<h1>Julia M&uuml;nch</h1>
<p>
    Since 2022 I am a PhD student at the University of Liverpool under the supervision of Daniel Meyer. My main interests are complex 
    dynamics, especially Thurston theory, quasi-regular and quasi-conformal mappings and Sullivan's dictionary.

<h3>Organisation of events</h3>
<p>
    Co-organised the One Day Function Theory Meeting of 2025 with Daniel Meyer. Find the programme 
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/onedayfunctiontheorymeeting/2025?authuser=0">here</a>.
    
</p>
<p>
    Co-founded and co-organised with Marco Fava the Liv'in Maths seminar, autumn semester 2023 and spring semester 2024. We organised weekly seminars 
    given by local PhD students.

<h3>Outreach and creative projects</h3>
<p>
    I have tought an interactive class about 4-dimensional regular convex polytopes aimed at high-school students with a focus
    on the work by Alicia Boole Stott. If you are curious I am happy to send you the slides and worksheet!

<p>
    For a poster competition by the University of Liverpool's EDI committee I designed
